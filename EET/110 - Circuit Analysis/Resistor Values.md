# Resistors

1. Fixed Resistor
a. Carbon (most common)
Ranges = Variety
Ratings = 1W or Less.

b. Wire-Wound
Resistance Wire is wrapped around an insulating core.
Ranges = Large, 1 - Several Thousand ohms
Ratings = 5-100W

c. Carbon composition
Made out of finely divided carbon mixed with a powdered insulating material
Ranges = 1-20MOhm
Ratings = 1/10=2W

d. Surface-Mount (chip)
Ceramic-based
Ranges: From a fraction of an Ohm to 2M Ohm
Rating: 1/8 to 1/4W

e. Fusible
A Wire-wound, burn easily

2. Resistor Color Coding:
Resistors are color coded to mark the value R in Ohm

Black = 0
Brown = 1
Red = 2
Orange = 3
Yellow = 4
Green = 5
Blue = 6
Violet = 7
Gray = 8
White = 9

Resistor Color Stripes:
Use of bands or Stripes are most common type

Start with the band closest to the edge and read from left to right

Third band is either gold or silver

Gold is 0.1 = 10^-1
Silver = 0.01 = 10^-2

## Resistor Tolerance
The amount that can be different from color-coded one usually given in Y.

For Fourth band:

Gold = +- 5%
Silver = +-10%
No-band = +-20%

For Fifth band:

Brown +- 1%
Red +- 2%
Green +- 0.5%
Blue +- 0.25%
Violet +- 0.10%

## Variable Resistors
a. Potentiometer
b. Rheostat

Potentiometer used for Voltage control
Rheostat used for Current control

Potentiometer: Three terminal device

Resistance between 1 & 2 is fixed

Resistance between terminals 1&3 or 2&3 are variables

Rheostat: Two terminal device

Rheostat is a current control device

Automatically variable resistor

1. Thermistor - Is a temperature sensitive resistor, resistance changes inversely with temperature.
2. Photo conductive cell - Its resistance changes with a change in the light intensity (inversely)

Switches: Are commonly used for controlling the opening or closing of a circuit
can be electrical or electro-mechanical

1. Single pole-single throw (SP-ST)
2. Single pole-double throw (SP-DT)
3. Push button Switch

Protective devices
1. Fuse -> Low current
2. Circuit breaker -> High current
