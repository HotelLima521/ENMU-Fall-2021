## Voltage

V= W/q

(V)(q) = W

1V = 1J/1C

## Current

Unit for current is Ampere

1 Ampere: If 6.242 x 10^18 Electrons per second at any point of a conductor

6.242 represents the charge of a Coulomb

I = q/t

I = d

I = d(q)/d(t)

I = Current in Ampere
q = Charge in Coulomb
t = Time in seconds

1A = 1C/1A

## Resistance

Resistance: Opposition to the flow of current

Copper has a very low resistance

The unit of Resistance is Ohm

One Ohm: A resistance that develps 0.24 Calories of heat when one ampere of current flows through it for one seconds

V = I x R

I = V/R

R = V/I

1ohm = 1V/1A

Conductance G = I/R

Siemens is the symbol of Conductance (20S)

## Types of Current

1. DC (Direct Current): Flow of charges in only one direction
2. AC (Alternating Current): An alernating voltage source generate alternating current

## Resistors
Resistors are the most common component in an electronic circuit
Their function is to reduce the current to a desired value.

Types of resistors:
1. Fixed
2. Variable (Potentiometer)

Two main characteristics of a Resistor:

1. Resistance value in Ohms
2. Power rating

Power rating: The amount of heat a resistor can dissipate before burn out.
