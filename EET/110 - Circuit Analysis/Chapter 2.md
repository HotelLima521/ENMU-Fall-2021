All materials including Solids, Liquids, and gas ontians two basic particles
1. Electrons: Smallest amount of electric charge with negative polarity (-)
2. Protons: Smallest amount of electric charge with positive polarity (+)

The arrangement of electrons & protons determine the electric characteristics of all substances.

Atom: Smallest particle of basic elements
All protons are in nucleous, electrons are in the orbit (shell)
Atomic number = the number of protons in an atom

Carbon = C = (+6) )2 ))4
2n^2 Law
n = Orbit number
n = 1, 2(1)^2=2
n = 2, 2(2)^2=8
n = 3, 2(3)^2=18
n = 4, 2(4)^2=32

Any element with four electrons in its last shell is called a semi-conductor. Carbon has four electrons in its last (second) shell, and two electrons in its first shell.

Copper = Cu = (+29)   )2  ))8 )))18 ))))1

Classifications of materials
1. Conductor: electrons can move easily from atom to atom. All metals are good conductors. Conductors have 1 electron in its last shell, allowing for high flow rates of electrons.
	- Application: Transfer of electric energy
2. Insulator: electrons stay in their own orbits. E.g. Glass, rubber, plastic, wood. Are able to hold/store electricity (dielectric). Last shell can not take more than 8.
	- Application: 
		a. Prevent current flow 
		b. Store electric charge
3. Semiconductor: Conduct less than metal but more than Insulators. All elements with four electrons in the last shell is called a semi-conductor. E.g. Carbon, Silicon.

Unit of Electric charge:

1 Coulomb (C): Equal to the charge of 6.242x10^18 electrons or Protons

X = 1/6.242x10^18 = 1.6-x(10^-10)C

The Symbol of charge= q (fixed) or q\ (variable)

Two opposite charges have a difference of potential.
+Q -Q
Unit of potential difference is Volt.
A Potential difference of 1V exists between two points if 1J of energy required is moving 1C of charge
V = W\u
V = Potential difference in Volts
W = Energy in Joules
u = Charge in C

1V = 1J\1C
