# Wires

They vary in diameter and are arranged according to standard gauge number called *American Wire Gauge (AWG)* sizes.

The Large the gauge number, the smaller the wire diameter is.

R = P(l/A)

P = Resitivity
L = Length
A = Cross-Sectional Area

A=(pi)(r)^2 m^2

- US, a unit of cross sectional area for wires in circular mill (CM)

A = d^2 CM
0.001 inch = 1 mill

R = ft/cm (English System)

P = RA/l = ohms(CM)/ft

Example: Find the resistance of 100ft length of copper wire that has a diameter of .003 inch
P =10.4x10^-2 (CM-ohm/ft)

A^2 = d^2

0.003 inch = 3mil

A = d^2 = (3mil)^2 = 9CM

R = 10.4 x 10-^2
CM-Ohm/ft x 100ft/9cm = 1.156ohm

## Grounds

Ground means zero potential (Reference point)

In electrical and electronic systems, the metal chasis that houses the assembly is a ground

Ground is a reference point in an electrical circuit that has a potential of 0 Volt.

Types of ground:
1. Earth ground
2. Chassis ground
3. AC Ground

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's law describes the mathematical relationship among voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.

V = I x R

I = V/R

R = V/I
