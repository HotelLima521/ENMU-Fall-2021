# A few notes

Upon the submission procedure, when you stated **Please do not submit the snapshot of your code.**,
were you talking about screenshots? Surely not source files right?

For compressed archives, would you prefer them in a different format such as some form of tarball? E.g.
<filename>.tar.gz or <filename>.tar.xz, etc. *OR* would you prefer to just view the source on my [git 
server](https://git.hl521.me/derek/ENMU-Fall-2021/-/tree/master/EET/122%20-%20Programming%20Fundamentals%20with%20C%20%26%20C%2B%2B)

Feel free to get back to me in person, or at [my email](derek@hl521.me).
