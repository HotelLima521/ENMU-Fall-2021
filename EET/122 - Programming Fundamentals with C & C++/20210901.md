# Expressions
- In C++, there are no symbols for power/root. To compute them, you must call a function
- To use sqrt and pow functions, you must place the line `#include <cmath>` at the top of your program file.

## Comments
- You should add comments which explain your code. This helps programmers who read your code understand your intent.
- You can use the // delimiter for short ocmments. If you hav a longer comment enclose it between `/* */` delimiters. The compiler ignores these delimiters and everything in between.

## Constant vars
- When a variable is definied with the reserved word const, it's value can never change
- Constants are generally written in capital letters to distinguish them visually from regular variables

## Boolean Expressions
- Boolean data types has exactly two values: True or False.
- An expression/condition that returns either true or false is a Boolean expression.

Evaluate the following Boolean expression: 

5 >= 3 -> True
3 > 8 -> False
10 < 8 -> False

Decisions:

If it rains today, I will stay home.
**Condition**, **Decision**.
