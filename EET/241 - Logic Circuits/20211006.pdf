# Chapter 4 - Boolean Addition

Variable, complement, and literal are terms used in Boolean algebra. A variable is a symbol used to represent an action, a condition, or data. Any single variable can have only a 1 or 0 value.

**Boolean Addition:**
- Boolean addition is equivalent to the OR operation
- In Boolean algebra, a sum term is a sum of literals. In logic circuits, a sum term is produced by an OR operation with no AND operations involved.

**Boolean Multiplication:**
- Boolean multiplication is equivalent to the AND operation.
- In Boolean algebra, a product term is the product of literals. In logic circuits, a product term is produced by an AND operation with no OR operations involved.

## Laws of Boolean Algebra

**Commutative Laws:**

*Addition*
- A+B = B+A

*Multiplication*
- AB = BA

**Associative Laws:**

*Addition*
- A + (B+C) = (A+B) + C

*Multiplication*
- A (BC) = (AB) C

**Distributive Laws:**

- A(B+C) = AB + AC
