# Repeated Multiplication by 2 Method: Converting fractional decimal numbers to binary
1. Multiply fractional number by 2. Keep multiplying resultant fractional part by 2 until the fractional product is zero.
2. This carries generated by multiplications produce the binary number. The first carry is the MSB, and the lsat carry is the LSB.

Example 1: Convert fractional number 0.3125 to binary using repeated multiplication by 2 method.

**0** 0.3125 x 2 = .625 *MSB*
**1** .625 x 2= .25
**0** .25 x 2 = .5
**1** .5 x 2 = 1.0 *LSB*

0.3125(10) = 0.0101(2)

## Binary addition

Four basic rules of binary addition:

0+0 = 0 sum = 0, carry = 0

0+1 = 1 sum = 1, carry = 0

1+0 = 0, sum = 1, carry = 0

1+1 = 10, sum = 0, carry = 1

Example 1:

1+1+1 = 11, sum = 1, carry = 1

Example 2:

110 + 100 = 1010

## Binary Subtraction

A borrow is required in binary only when you try to subtract a 1 from a 0. In this case, when a 1 is borrowed from the next column to the left, a 10 is created in the column when being subtracted.

0 - 0 = 0
1 - 1 = 0
1 - 0 = 1
0 - 1 = 1 with a borrow of 1; 10 - 1 = 1

## Binary Multiplication

It involves forming partial products, shifting each successive partial product left one place, then adding all the partial products.

Four basic rules of binary multiplication:

0 x 0 = 0
0 x 1 = 0
1 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1

## Complements of Binary Numbers

- The 1's complement and the 2's complement of a binary number are important because they permit the representation of negative numbers.
- The method of 2's complement arithmetic is commonly used in computers to handle negative numbers.

**Finding the 1's Complement:**
- The 1's complement of a binary number is found by changing all 1's to 0's and all 0's to 1's.

Example: Find 1's complement of 10110010

10110010
*01001101*

- The 2's complement of a binary number is found by adding 1 to the LSB of the 1's complement

2's complement = (1's complement)+1

See Diagram for example.
