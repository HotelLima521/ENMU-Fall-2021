# Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion

Simply break the binary number into 4-bit groups, starting at the right-most bit and replace each 4-bit group with the equivalent hexadecimal symbol.

Example: Convert the following binary numbers to hexadecimal:

A. 1100101001010111
1100 1010 0101 0111
12    10   5    7
**CA57**

B. Convert the following binary to hexadecimal:
0001 0110 1001
1	6	9
**169**

## Hexadecimal to Binary conversion

To convert from a hexadecimal number to binary number, reverse the process and replace each hexadecimal symbol with the appropriate four bits.

Example: Determine the binary numbers fo the following hexadecimal numbers:
a. 10A4

1 0 10 4

**0001 0000 1010 0100**

b. CF8E

12 15 8 14

**1100 1111 1000 1110**

## Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

One way to find the decimal equivalent of a hexadecimal number is to first convert the hexadecimal number to binary and then convert from binary to decimal

Example: Convert the following hexadecimal numbers to decimal:

a. A85

1010 1000 0101
4096+1024+256+4+1=**5381**

## Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion: Repeated division by 16

- To convert the decimal number to hexadecimal, begin by dividing decimal number by 16.
- Then divide each resulting quotient by 16 until there is a 0 whole number quotient. The remainders generated by each division form the hexadecimal number.
- The first remainder to be produced is the LSD (least significant digit), and the last remainder to be produced is the MSD (most significant digit).

Example: Convert the decimal number 650 to hexadecimal by repeated division by 16.

## Hexadecimal addition

- In any given column of an addition problem, think of the two hexadecimal digits in terms of their decimal values. For instance, 5(16) = 5(10) and C(16) = 12(10).
- If the sum of these two digits is 15(10) or less, bring down the corresponding hexadecimal digit.
- If the sum of these two digits is greater than 15(10), bring down the amount of the sum that exceeds 16(10) an carry a 1 to the next column

Example: Add the following Hexadecimal numbers:

a. 23+16 = 39(16)

b. DF+AC = 18B(16)
