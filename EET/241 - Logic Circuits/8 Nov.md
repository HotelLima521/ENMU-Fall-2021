# Karnuagh Map POS Minimization

## Mapping a Standard POS Expression

Step 1: Determine the binary value of each sum term in the standard POS expression.
This is the binary value tha tmakes the term equal to 0.

Step 2: As each sum term is evaluated, place a 0 on the Karnaugh map in the corresponding cell

## Karnuagh map simplification of POS expressions

The process for minimizing a POS expression is basically the same as for an SOP expression except that you group 0's to produce minimum sum terms instead of grouping 1's to produce minimum product terms.

The rules for grouping the 0's are the same for grouping hte 1's that you learned in the previous section.
