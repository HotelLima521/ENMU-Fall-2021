# Karnaugh map SOP Minimization

## Mapping a Standard SOP Expression

Step 1: Determine the binary value of each product term in the standard SOP expression

Step 2: As each product term is evaluated, place a 1 on the karnaugh map in the cell having the same value as the product term.

Example: Map the following standard SOP expression on a Karnaugh map:

## Mapping a Nonstandard SOP Expression

A Boolean expression must first be in standard form before you use karnaugh map. If an expression is not in standard form, then it must be converted to standard form.
*Numerical Expansion of a Nonstandard Product term:*
- Write the binary value of the variables and then attach all possible values for the mising variables.

Determine the binary value of the product term A!B in a certain 3-var SOP expression:

A!B = Non-standard product term

Determine the binary value of the product term B in a certain 3-var SOP expression:
