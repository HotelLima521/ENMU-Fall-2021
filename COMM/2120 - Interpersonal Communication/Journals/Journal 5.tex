%Review the section titled “Common Tendencies in Perception” (pgs. 134-139).
%Provide an example of a time in your life when you have experienced each tendency. (You should have six examples, one example per tendency). Within each example, answer the following:
%What were the outcomes?
%Would the outcomes be different if that tendency had not played a part in your perception?

%We make Snap Judgements
\par
%When I was in Las Vegas attending a convention called "DEFCON", I was intercepted by a stranger in the middle of a casino. I made the snap decision that this guy was on some form of hard drug and to distance myself as he began frantically saying he was running from security. The outcome of this snap judgement was that we left a potentially bad scenario, especially when my friend that was with me was pregnant. If the outcomes were different from this perception, and we didn't promptly distance ourselves, maybe he could have gotten offended somehow and attempted to assault one of us.
While in Las Vegas attending DEFCON, I was intercepted by a stranger in the middle of a casino. I made the snap judgement that this guy was on some form of hard drug and distanced myself as he began frantically saying he was running from security. The outcome of this decision allowed us to avoid a potentially dangerous scenario. One that could have been much worse because my accompanying friend was pregnant. Without my instinct and perception, the situation would have been different and if we didn't promptly distance ourselves, he may have gotten offended somehow and attempted to assault one of us.
%We cling to first impressions
\par
Clinging to first impressions is a perception that I continue to struggle with my landlord on. I still perceive her as a sweet old lady that is very accommodating, where in reality she judges quite harshly and is voraciously racist. She has caught me off guard talking about various races or other religions that weren't white or Christian in a completely inappropriate way for \emph{any} audience. The outcomes of this situation was a complete shock out of the things that she has said and me beginning to reevaluate my living situation as her tenant. The outcome would potentially be different if I \emph{knew} she acted this way, since I would more than likely never have met her-- and would have likely never become her tenant. 
%We Judge ourselves more charitably than we do others
\par
I have noticed that I tend to judge myself more charitably than others when it comes to keeping a tidy house or car. When my house is untidy I blame it on my ADHD or depression, whereas when I see a friend with a dirty house or vehicle I just assume that they are lazy when in reality they are most likely facing the same problems. There aren't really any outcomes to this since I don't comment on people's untidy homes since I think it's rude especially when I am just as guilty at it. However, if I didn't face this problem I would most likely not want to associate with people who keep dirty homes like that.

%We are influenced by our expectations
\par
The most recent time I have been influenced by my expectations was when I was deploying to Turkey. I was warned of two people there, one would be my coworker and another would be my supervisor. I didn't remember their names too well as I was heading out to my deployment, nor did I know their faces, but I knew to expect that their performance was garbage and to expect garbage. The outcome of this expectation was the supervisor was kicked out of the Air Force after threatening me when I caught him committing adultery, and me punching the coworker in the face after he began to verbally berate and push me. I don't think the outcome would have been any different however if I wasn't influenced by my expectations, due to those scenarios being quite a bit outside of my control.
%The most recent time I have been influenced by my expectations wasn't with a person per se, however was with a video card for my computer. I was frustrated with video drivers from Nvidia, and decided that I needed to make a change to AMD since their drivers were open source instead of proprietary; allowing the drivers for the card itself to be implemented directly into my kernel and the 3D acceleration drivers built into the Mesa package, which is an open source collection of 3D acceleration drivers. The outcomes of this perception was a significant improvement in quality of life since I use my PC so often, and not having to worry about proprietary drivers breaking my system helped out a lot. If the outcomes were different, and I would still be using Nvidia as my video card, I would still be dealing with a ton of driver issues on my system.
%We are influenced by the obvious
\par
I have been influenced by the obvious recently. My friend has been struggling with having a daughter, and recently broke up with his girlfriend whilst trying to make enough money to provide for his daughter. I have been waiting half a year for him to finish working on my Jeep so it will be winter ready, and practically no work has been done on it. My perception of him was he is just too lazy to get it done, whereas in reality he is far too busy, and far too focused to obtain enough money to stay afloat that I am the least priority at the moment. The outcomes of this perception was frustration on my end for not having a winter-ready vehicle available. The outcomes of this perception would be different because I would have most likely just brought my Jeep to another friend to work on it for me so it would be handled on time.
%We assume others are like us
\par
Assuming others are like us is a perception I run into all too often. Once I get good enough at a skill set, I forget what others don't know and assume they are at a similar skill level to me as if it's common knowledge. I feel like this happens the most when we begin to devote a lot of our time to specific skill sets, for example vehicle mechanics, Information Technology, Construction, etc. You learn in depth in something super specific and forget what people \emph{don't} know. This has happened to me quite a few times, I worked in a specialized field in the Air Force where we would have to setup satellite communications on various air frames, and when other radio or network technicians came in they would be confused between either having to learn networking, having to learn radio theory, or having to learn some server management skill sets. The outcome was both parties (them and I) being equally frustrated at the scenario as we had to learn how to properly communicate the question and the answer. The outcome would be significantly different if this tendency had not played a part in this perception, since I would have known to start from the beginning relatively speaking, and ease the new technician into the environment.
