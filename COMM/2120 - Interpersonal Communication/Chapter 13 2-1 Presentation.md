Hey guys, I'm Derek, and I'll be talking about Levels of Message Confirmation.

Firstly, Recognition is essentially what we initially consider acknowledging someone in a conversation, verbally or nonverbally

Positive examples of this, would be a legitimate smile when greeting someone for a non verbal Recognition

Or, you can also say "Hey what's up!"

Negative examples of Recognition would be rolling your eyes in a negative context, ignoring someone when they are talking to you, etc.

So, if we were to play out a situation, say you are at a car dealership. A salesman will run out wave to you in recognition, and ask how you're doing with a smile!

Next, Acknowledgement. This is Recognition, but deeper.

Acknowledgement is when you carefully listen to someone and then respond accurately

Acknowledgement shows how in depth you listen to someone, how much you value what they have to say

This doesn't mean you do necessarily value what they have to say though.

For example, stating "I understand", or "That's a solid point" are acceptable acknowledgements

Finally Endorsing. Endorsing is the strongest and most effective level of Message Confirmation.

Endorsement is when you fully agree and support another person in a conversation.

For example, political conversations are very popular with this recently depending on the side of the spectrum you are on.

This can be with any topic though.

This can be accomplished non-verbally too, such as hugging someone to show that you feel the same way
