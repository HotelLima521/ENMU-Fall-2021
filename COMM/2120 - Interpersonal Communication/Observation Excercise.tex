\title{Observation Exercise}

% What dynamics do you see between the people you're observing?
% What sort of relationship are you observing - parent/child, siblings, friends, a married couple, etc.
% What transpires in the interaction?
% What do you hear and see?
% What can you tell about the relationship from what is said. And, what can you tell about the relationship by what IS NOT said? And lest you think this is eavesdropping, you're functioning as a social science researcher!

% Two students, female, TTU

% Dynamics?

\par
The dynamics between the couple I am observing are quiet and focused on their assignment. They look like third year students from Texas Tech University that are either friends, or fellow students within the same class. The only thing that transpired in this interaction was quick comments about the assignment. I hear very quiet conversation, as if they don't want to bother anyone in the coffee shop, and see them intently working away on an assignment. I can't really tell what is being said in the conversation since they are speaking so quiet, and the noise from the road is so loud, but their conversation was definitely only about school work.

\par
The dynamics between this group of people are energetic, happy, and engaged. They appear to be strangers, but enjoy talking about sports teams, and are comparing American football to military tactics. I see them actively watching the football game on the television whilst talking to random people coming up to the bar, and the bar tenders.
