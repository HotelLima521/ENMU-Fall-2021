## Communication Process
messages = meaning
- Tone
- Body language
- Urgency

In 1950, it was believed that communication was one way.

(sender -> reciever)

Transactional Communication is when it's two way communication (sender <-> reciever).


Environment:
- Location
- Experiences
- Cultural Backgrounds
- Interference with communication, such as busy house during school work (e.g. Online school whilst a ton of other distractions at home).

Noise:
- External noise (Squeaking from boots, pens clicking, literally any mechanical noise that we would by default consider the definition of "Noise")
- Physiological noise (Biological, e.g. Hunger, upset stomach, sick, etc).
- Psychological noise (Thoughts racing through head, various mental disorders, depression, issues within family such as health issues, financial issues, etc).
