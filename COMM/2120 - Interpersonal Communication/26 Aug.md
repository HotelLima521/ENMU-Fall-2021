# Sketch Notes

Sketching can be far easier to remember a concept due to the visualization over words.

```

--------- - Social
| Needs | - Practical
--------- - Identity
|
Physical

```

- Identity, Your "brand"
- Physical, 
- Social, anything that has to do with the five love languagues, communiation, etc.
- Practical needs, anything as simple as food, mechanical problems with cars, technology, etc.
